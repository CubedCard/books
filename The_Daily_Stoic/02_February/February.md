# The Daily Stoic – February  
### Topic: Restraint and Emotional Control  

February centers on composure. True strength isn’t aggression — it’s calm. Self-control and patience shape how you
respond to life’s provocations.

## Key Ideas
- Aggression is not attractive nor scary; calm is terrifying
- Don’t (immediately) act on your impulses
- Ask a crying person (including yourself): “Is this helpful?”
- See life as a dinner — wait for your turn 
- What’s better left unsaid 
- Prioritise what matters most
