# The Daily Stoic – September  
### Topic: Simplicity and Acceptance  

September turns toward simplicity and the Stoic embrace of pain as a teacher.

## Key Ideas
- One day a month of simplicity or isolation
- Pain is good, temporary, and real 
- Fear is bad: if you worry, you suffer twice
- Reflect on how you used to live — don’t get caught up in luxury
