# The Daily Stoic – May  
### Topic: Discipline and Integrity  

May explores character through consistent action. You can’t recognize a Stoic by appearance, only by what they do.

## Key Ideas
- You can’t recognize a Stoic — only by character
- Don’t break the chain (habit-building)
- Work on your work 
- Be a good person
- Have a good day by doing good things
- Keep an “anger calendar” to track and reduce emotional outbursts
