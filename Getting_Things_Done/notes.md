# Summary (Getting Things Done - David Allen)

1. Identify what’s on your mind.
Capture it all—big projects, vague worries, unfinished tasks. Write everything down so it’s out of your head and into a
trusted system. This act alone releases cognitive tension.

2. Define the intended successful outcome.
Ask: What would “done” look like? That’s the project definition. For instance, “kitchen remodel” becomes “kitchen
redesigned and ready for daily use.” That clarity turns amorphous obligations into concrete goals.

3. Determine the very next physical action.
Not “figure out travel plans,” but “email Lisa about flight options.” The next physical action is the bridge between
thought and motion. Once you know it, you can actually start.
