# Notes (How To Win Friends And Influence People - Dale Carnegie)

## Core Principles

### Building Rapport
- **Smile:** A genuine smile sets a positive tone and invites connection.
- **Remember Names:** Use and remember people’s full names — it shows respect and attention.
- **Show Interest:** Take an active interest in the other person’s passions and experiences.

### Conversation & Listening
- **Let Them Talk About Themselves:** People appreciate being heard more than being advised.
- **Be a Good Listener:** Encourage others to share and listen attentively without interruption.

### Attitude & Motivation
- **Think About the Goal, Not the Credit:** Focus on outcomes, not personal recognition.
- **Admit When You Are Wrong:** Humility disarms defensiveness and builds trust.

### Persuasion Tactics
- **Make Suggestions Instead of Giving Orders:** Empower others to take ownership of decisions. 
- **Get Them Saying “Yes, Yes” Early:** Establish agreement and positive momentum early in conversation.
