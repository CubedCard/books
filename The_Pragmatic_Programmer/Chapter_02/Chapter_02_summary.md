# Chapter 2 — A Pragmatic Approach

## Key Ideas
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** — every piece of knowledge should have one source of truth. If changing one thing means changing others, you’re not DRY.
- **Orthogonality** — keep components independent; one change shouldn’t break another. Independence breeds flexibility.
- **Reversibility** — design so you can change direction later; don’t paint yourself into a corner.
- **Tracer bullets vs. Prototypes**
  - **Prototypes**: throwaway learning tools; often fake or partial. Label them clearly as temporary.
  - **Tracer bullets**: real, working vertical slices through the system; evolve into the final product.
- **Estimating** — it’s a skill built by tracking, measuring, and reflecting. Compare estimates vs. actuals and learn from the gaps.
- **Rapid prototyping** — use high-level tools (Python, whiteboard, Post-its) and dummy data when speed and clarity matter.

## Core Message
> Pragmatic development means staying flexible, reducing duplication, and learning from every iteration — aim for designs you can change, not just complete.
