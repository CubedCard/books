# Chapter 1 — A Pragmatic Philosophy

## Key Ideas
- **Take responsibility** — own your code, your bugs, your learning. Don’t make excuses; say “I’ll fix it” or “I’ll find out.”
- **Fix broken windows early** — small neglect grows into big messes. Clean things up before they spread.
- **Stone Soup principle** — get others involved by starting small; show progress and people will contribute.
- **Set personal goals** — keep learning, read technical books, explore new languages, and stay sharp.
- **Communicate effectively** — know your audience, explain clearly, and document the *why* behind your code.
- **Professional mindset** — care about quality, clarity, and growth; don’t settle for “it works.”

## Core Message
> Pragmatism in software isn’t cutting corners — it’s about responsibility, awareness, and deliberate craftsmanship.
